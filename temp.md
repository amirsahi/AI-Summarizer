## Summary
Neutral-atom quantum computers successfully created high-fidelity magic states via distillation, a key advance towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.

## Full Content
Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science [1, 2, 3, 4]. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such encoded qubits is often constrained [12, 1], necessitating the use of special resource states known as ‘magic states’ [13] to implement universal, classically hard circuits [14]. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform ‘distillation’, creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs [15, 13]. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a dynamically reconfigurable architecture [16, 8] to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d = 3 and d = 5 color codes, observing improvements of the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors.
